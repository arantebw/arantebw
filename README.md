# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Billy!

I'm a computer programmer; I contribute to open-source software projects; currently I'm a full-time Software Engineer at [goodfrontend.dev](https://goodfrontend.dev); on my free time I create open-source software projects and blogs at [B.A. Techblogs](https://techblogs.gatsbyjs.io). Aside from web development and cloud computing, I am enthusiastic about machine learning and cybersecurity.
